# Photo-Labeler
Very simple, and pretty dumb, photo labeler

takes as command line args \<log file\> and \<img-dir\>. In the logfile it will just append the name of the image, and the the single character you pressed for that image. 

Also takes \<img dir\> where it will recursively search for all images ending in ".jpg"

The program will not show you any images you have previously seen, decided based on the given log file.

## TODO
Allow correction of recently seen photos by scrolling backwards and overwriting

Allow multicharacter inputs, delineated by the enter key
